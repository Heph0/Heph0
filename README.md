### Hi there 👋. 
#### I am Albert Sanchez. By day, I am a application developer that is working on business analytics(temp). 
#### By night, I am working on side projects. In the afternoons, I enjoy walking around or laying down reading a good manga.
#### I recently decided to pick more coding related side projects, and so here we are. Please code review my work.
#### If you have any suggestions to tweak something or improve its performance let me know. I am open to suggestions just post an Issue.

#### 👷 Check out what I'm currently working on
